Background
---
This project is based on tensorflow 1.0, and python 2.7.

I spent quite a few days trying to improve the accuracy of this model, some cannot work, and some can. I have achieved 4.8% error rate on sequencial digits recognition. As a beginner of machine learning, it's quite good for me. But there are still quite a lot modern net structure I haven't use, so I believe it should be able to achieve even higher accuracy.

Usage

1. Download [train.tar.gz](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/train.tar.gz), [test.tar.gz](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/test.tar.gz), [extra.tar.gz](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/extra.tar.gz)
2. Extract them into `/train_data`
3. Run `svhn_data.py` to generate tfrecord files
4. The data is ready now. You can run `svhn_train.py` to train it from start, or copy everything from `ckpt-95.1%-acc/` to `ckpt/`(if there is no `ckpt/` folder, create one), and run `svhn_eval.py` to get the model accuracy
5. If you want to train the model from start, make sure there is nothing in `ckpt/`, or it will load the ckeckpoints from `ckpt/`. The checkpoint is saved in `train_data/`, if you want to continue from your last training, then just put your last checkpoint into `ckpt/`
6. Run python multi_digit_reader.py image-name.png to read a complete image. This is not accurate at all, I'm trying to come up with a better way.
